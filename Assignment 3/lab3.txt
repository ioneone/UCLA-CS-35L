1. verify the signature of coreutils 8.29 with the GNU keystring

	Command:
		wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

		wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

		gpg --verify --keyring 
		/gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

	Output:
		gpg: directory `/u/cs/ugrad/junhong/.gnupg' created
		gpg: new configuration file 
		`/u/cs/ugrad/junhong/.gnupg/gpg.conf' created
		gpg: WARNING: options in 
		`/u/cs/ugrad/junhong/.gnupg/gpg.conf' 
		are not yet active during this run
		gpg: keyring `/u/cs/ugrad/junhong/.gnupg/pubring.gpg' created
		gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST 
		     using RSA key ID 306037D9
		gpg: /u/cs/ugrad/junhong/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
		gpg: Good signature 
		from "P치draig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
		gpg:                 aka "P치draig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
		gpg:                 aka "P치draig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
		gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified 
		with a trusted signature!
		gpg:          There is no indication 
		that the signature belongs to the owner.
		Primary key fingerprint:
		6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9

	Note:
		The verification worked fine because of this line.

			Good signature from 
			"P치draig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"		

		It is verified that the package was not tampered.

		gnu-keyring.gpg contains the public key made by the
		developer to decrypt the signature.

		"A digital signature certifies and timestamps a document. 
		If the document is subsequently modified in any way, 
		a verification of the signature will fail. 
		A digital signature can serve the same purpose as a 
		hand-written signature with the additional benefit 
		of being tamper-resistant."

		A signature file is hashed with the original coreutil files.
		If someone in the middle tampered the file,
		it will change the hash algorithm of the signature file.
		That's how we will know if the package was 
		tampered by a middle person.

		It says the it is not a trusted signature because the person
		is not listed as a trusted developer in OS.
		

2. intall coreutils to coreutilsInstall

	Command:
		wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz

		tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz 

	Note:
		tar -xJvf to unzip the .tar.xz file

	Command:
		mkdir coreutilsInstall

		cd coreutilsInstall

		pwd

	Output:
		/u/cs/ugrad/junhong/coreutilsInstall

	Note:
		use pwd to check the absolute path of coreutilsInstall directory

	Command:
		cd ..

		cd coreutils-8.29
		
	
	Note:
		specify the directory path for installing coreutils

	Command:

		./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/junhong/coreutilsInstall

		make

		make install

	Note:
		Install coreutils to coreutilsInstall


3. reproduce the error

	Command:
		cd ..

		cd coreutilsInstall

		cd bin

	Note:
		go to ./coreutilsIntall/bin

	Command:
		man ls

	Note:
		ls -a option means all, 
		and do not ignore entries starting with .
		ls -A option means almost all, 
		and do not list implied . and ..

	Command:
		./ls -a

	Output:
		.
		..
		'['
		b2sum
		base32
		base64
		basename
		cat
		
	Note:
		Only showing first few outputs here. 
		It is verified that -a does not ignore entries starting with .
		
	Command:
		./ls -A

	Output:
		'['
		b2sum
		base32
		base64
		basename
		cat

	Note:
		Only showing first few outputs here
		It is verified that -A does not list implied . and ..

	Command:
		./ls -Aa
	
	Output:
		.
		..
		'['
		b2sum
		base32
		base64
		basename
		cat

	Note:
		Only showing first few outputs here.
		Using -a followed by -A seems okay.

	Command:
		./ls -aA

	Output:
		.
		..
		'['
		b2sum
		base32
		base64
		basename
		cat

	Note:
		Only showing first few outputs here.
		It seems -A option does NOT override -a option.
		This is a bug!

	
4. Apply patch

	Command:
		cd ~

		cd coreutils-8.29

		emacs patch.diff

	paste the follow to patch.diff:

		--- a/src/ls.c
		+++ b/src/ls.c
		@@ -1903,8 +1903,7 @@ decode_switches (int argc, char **argv)
           		break;
 
         		case 'A':
		-          if (ignore_mode == IGNORE_DEFAULT)
		-            ignore_mode = IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT;
		+          ignore_mode = IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT;
		           break;
 
		        case 'B':

	Command:
		X-x X-c y

	Note:
		exit emacs

	Command:
		patch -p1 < patch.diff

	Output:
		patching file src/ls.c
		patch unexpectedly ends in middle of line
		Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 with fuzz 1 (offset -3 lines).

	Note:
		use patch to apply patch
		-p[num] option to ignore up to [num]th directory
		specified in the patch file

	
5. Type the command make

	Command:
		make

	Note:
		re-compile the change due to patch
		make install is not used because 
		it will install it into coreutilsInstall


6. Check if bug is fixed

	Command:
		cd src

	Note:
		go to src directory where all the commands are stored

	Command:
		./ls -aA

	Output:
		'['
		b2sum
		base32

	Note:
		Only showing first few outputs.
		It seems -A has successfully overridden -a option.

	Command:
		./ls -Aa

	Output:
		.
		..
		'['
		b2sum
		base32

	Note:
		Only showing first few outputs.
		-Aa is same as -a option. Looks good.
