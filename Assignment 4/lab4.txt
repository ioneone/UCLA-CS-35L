1. Install coreutils-with-bug

	Command:
		wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs35L/assign/coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz

	Note:
		download coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz

	Command:
		tar -xzf coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz

	Note:
		unzip .tar.gz file

	Command:
		mkdir coreutilsWithBugInstall
		cd coreutilsWithBugInstall
		pwd
	
	Output:
		/u/cs/ugrad/junhong/coreutilsWithBugInstall

	Note:
		check the absolute path of coreutilsWithBugInstall

	Command:
		cd ..
		cd coreutils-with-bug/
		./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/junhong/coreutilsWithBugInstall CFLAG='-g'
		make 
	
	Output:

	What problems did you have when building it as-is:
		Build Error occurred

	Command:
		wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff

	Note:
		wget the patch file in coreutils-with-bug directory

	Command:
		patch -p0 < coreutils.diff 

	Output:
		patching file lib/utimens.c
		patching file lib/utimens.h
		patching file src/copy.c
		patching file src/tee.c
		patching file src/touch.c
		
	Command:
		make
		make install

	Note:
		Successfully make and install the package

	why did the renaming patch fix them:
		Originally futimens had different arguments in h file and c file
		The patch fixed it.

	Command:
		cd ..
		cd coreutilsWithBugInstall
		cd bin
		cd pwd

	Output:
		/u/cs/ugrad/junhong/coreutilsWithBugInstall/bin
		
2. Reproduce bug

	Command:
		cd ~
		tmp=$(mktemp -d)
		cd $tmp
		touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
		touch now
		sleep 1
		touch now1

		TZ=UTC0 /u/cs/ugrad/junhong/coreutilsWithBugInstall/bin/ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1

	Output:
		-rw-r--r-- 1 junhong csugrad 0 1918-11-11 11:00:00.000000000 +0000 
		wwi-armistice
		-rw-r--r-- 1 junhong csugrad 0 2019-02-02 03:23:44.150609243 +0000 now1
		-rw-r--r-- 1 junhong csugrad 0 2019-02-02 03:23:36.363394952 +0000 now
		

3. Debug the bug

	Command:
		cd ~
		cd coreutils-with-bug
		cd src
		
	Note:
		go to the package src directory and find the bug

	Command:
		emacs ls.c
		C-s sort
		C-s
		C-s
		C-s
		C-s sort_time
		C-s
		C-s
		C-s
		C-s
		
	Note:
		something is wrong with compare_ctime, compare_mtime or compare_atime

	Command:
		C-x
		C-c

	Note:
		exit emacs
		
	Command:
		gdb ls
	
	Note:
		open ls with debugger

	Command:
		break compare_ctime
	
	Note:
		put break point at function compare_ctime

	Command:
		run -lt

	Note:
		check if compare_ctime is called with -lt option.
		The program didn't stop. In other words,
		compare_ctime was not called.

	Command:
		break compare_mtime

	Note:
		put break point at function compare_mtime

	Command:
		run -lt

	Note:
		check if compare_mtime is called with -lt option.
		The program did stop before calling compare_mtime.

	Command:
		list
		step
		list
		step
		list

	Output:
		timespec_cmp (b=..., a=...) at ../lib/timespec.h:48

		48	  int diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec;

		43	/* Return negative, zero, positive 
			if A < B, A == B, A > B, respectively.
		44	   Assume the nanosecond components are in range, 
			or close to it.  */
		45	static inline int
		46	timespec_cmp (struct timespec a, struct timespec b)
		47	{
		48	  int diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec;
		49	  return diff ? diff : a.tv_nsec - b.tv_nsec;
		50	}

	Note:
		It seems something is wrong with the comparator,
		which is located at ../lib/timespec.h

		If I used make CFLAGS='-g -O0'
		all variables will be visible during debugging.

	Command:
		quit
		y Enter

	Note:
		quit gdb

4. Create Patch

	Command:
		cd ..
		mkdir a

	Command:
		cp lib/timespec.h a/timespec.h
		emacs lib/timespec.h
	
	Change Before:
		int diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec;
		return diff ? diff : a.tv_nsec - b.tv_nsec;

	Change After:
		if (a.tv_sec == b.tv_sec) return a.tv_nsec - b.tv_nsec;
  		return (a.tv_sec < b.tv_sec) ? -1 : 1;

	Note:
		The problem was because of overflow of diff

	Command:
		C-x C-c (exit emacs)
		make
  
	Command:
		cd src
		pwd

	Output:
		/u/cs/ugrad/junhong/coreutils-with-bug/src

	Command:
		tmp=$(mktemp -d)
		cd $tmp
		touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
		touch now
		sleep 1
		touch now1

	Command:
		/u/cs/ugrad/junhong/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls -lt

	Output:
		total 0
		-rw-r--r-- 1 junhong csugrad 0 2019-02-06 23:15 now1
		-rw-r--r-- 1 junhong csugrad 0 2019-02-06 23:15 now
		-rw-r--r-- 1 junhong csugrad 0 1918-11-11 03:00 wwi-armistice

	Note:
		Bug is fixed!

	Command:
		cd /u/cs/ugrad/junhong/coreutils-with-bug/
		diff -u a/timespec.h lib/timespec.h > timespec.diff

	Note:
		create patch file

	Command:
		emacs
		C-x 4 a
	Note:
		open change log

	Content of change log:
		* timespec.h (timespec_cmp):
        	Fix issue where the date older than 1970 is not sorted correctly.
        	Instead of using subtraction, which may cause an overflow,
        	using direct comparison to prevent overflow.
		
	Command:
		cat ChangeLog >> lab4.diff
		cat timespec.diff >> lab4.diff
		
5. Reproduce the bug on SEASNet

	Command:
		cd ~
		touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
		touch now
		sleep 1
		touch now1
		TZ=UTC0 ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1

	Output:
		-rw-r--r-- 1 junhong csugrad 0 2054-12-17 17:28:16.000000000 +0000 wwi-armistice
		-rw-r--r-- 1 junhong csugrad 0 2019-02-07 22:07:37.047885000 +0000 now1
		-rw-r--r-- 1 junhong csugrad 0 2019-02-07 22:07:36.042793000 +0000 now

	Note:
		The sort itself is good, but the date of 
		wwi-armistice doesn't seem to be right.
		It should be 1918 but it becomes 2054.
		touch is doing something weird.
